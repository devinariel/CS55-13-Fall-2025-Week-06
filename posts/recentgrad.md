So...this weekend I did a thing 😆 
I achieved a goal I’ve been chasing for over a decade: I became a college graduate! 🎓

Now, you might be wondering, 
“Why did it take so long?”
Well, the short answer is: life happened. Initially it was healing from severe depression leading to a hiatus from school. Financial struggles presented challenges at another point. And then, of course, the pandemic came along. It often felt like one obstacle after another stood in my way. 

But here’s the thing, I didn’t let these setbacks crush my dreams. I regrouped and re-strategized. When the world seemed to pause in early 2020, I used the extra time to upskill, teaching myself photography alongside website and application development. I offered my services to clients who believed in my potential, which reignited my passion for using technology to connect with people. From there, I knew I had to continue working toward my dream, no matter the obstacles.

I’m sharing this story as a reminder to anyone facing a delayed dream. Deferred does NOT mean diminished. Keep your head held high and know that the universe is always working in your favor...you just have to believe it!

To my family, friends, instructors and lovely clients: 
Thank you for supporting me through this journey 🙏🏾
